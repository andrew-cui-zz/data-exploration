As I picked my English name in summer '16, one interesting statistic I came across was the linkage between names, popularity, and age - in both Freakonomics and FiveThirtyEight's [article here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/). Having seen several great examples of this work through other sources such as Flourish (below), and wanting to learn more about data visualization, I'm using this project to learn how to create a flexible/adaptable visualization. This is using the SSN names data: I will be attempting to do this both on a monthly and a overall focus within the US.
